Houses several of my own health-care related datasets and machine learning classifiers, which I developed using python libraries.

Inside the dataset folder are several datasets, created and cleaned entirely by myself, containing different commonly used audio features (i.e., spectral centroid, zero crossing rate, etc.). 

Inside the script folder, are several different classification algorithms which I tested my datasets on. These classifiers include validation techiniques (10-Fold, K-Fold, Stratisifed K-Fold), report on several metrics (precision, recall, f1-score, area under the curve (auc), specificity, sensitivity, and many more!) and data visualization.

All code is written in Python, but I also included a Random Forest file written in R. I did that just to get some practice with R.
